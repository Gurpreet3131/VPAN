# VPAN
One of the major challenges the blind community face today is navigating from one place to another and most of the time they are dependent on some other person for that. Tools have been made which allow them to ease outdoor navigation through the use of GPS [1, 2, and 3]. Since GPS does not work accurately in indoors as compared to outdoors therefore its credibility in guiding the user towards his destination cannot be trusted upon. VPAN system is an effort to overcome this limitation of GPS systems and assist visually impaired and blind people in navigating indoors. At the backend it relies on google cloud platform for doing its computations and in the front-end there would be a smartphone for processing the generated results required to guide the user to its destination. Location Approximation is done by creating a structural map (vertex labelled graph) of the whole building using images of the various points inside the buildings used as reference points[4] and in order to approximate the location of user we use the user’s field of vision with those already stored images inside our cloud. Although the results are still not enough to provide strong conclusions, they indicate that the system is suitable to guide visually impaired people through an unknown built environment and as the accuracy is concerned we can confidently say it’s up to 2.5 meters (approx.) based on the various trail runs.
